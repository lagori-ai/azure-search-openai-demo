#### **Title**: Multi-Indexing Implementation for Geographic Locations in `prepdocs_updated.py`

---

### **1. Purpose**

The purpose of this update is to enhance the document preparation and indexing system to support multiple indexes, each corresponding to a geographic location. By dynamically creating and processing separate indexes for subdirectories representing geographic locations, this update achieves improved scalability, flexibility, and operational efficiency in handling data.

Note: Changes are tagged with # multi-index-geo

---

### **2. Requirements**

1. **Multi-Indexing**:
   - Create a unique search index for each geographic location by appending the location identifier to the base index name.
   - Ensure that each index processes data from its corresponding location folder.

2. **Dynamic Folder Handling**:
   - Automatically detect subdirectories under a specified base path (`/data`) and treat each as a geographic location.

3. **Concurrent Execution**:
   - Process all location-based strategies concurrently to improve efficiency and reduce processing time.

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Ensure compatibility with existing functionalities and arguments wherever possible.

5. **Modifications to CLI**:
   - Update command-line arguments to accept a base directory containing subdirectories for geographic locations.

### **3. Changes Made**

#### **3.1 Function Changes**

##### **1. `setup_search_info`**
- **Purpose**: Create a search index name that includes the geographic location identifier.
- **Modification**:
  - Appended the `location` to the `index_name` dynamically.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  index_name = f"{index_name}_{location}"  # Append location to index name
  ```

##### **2. `setup_list_file_strategy`**
- **Purpose**: Detect subdirectories for geographic locations and create individual file strategies for each.
- **Modification**:
  - Iterates over subdirectories under the provided base path (`local_files`) and creates a mapping of strategies.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  for location in os.listdir(local_files):
      location_path = os.path.join(local_files, location)
      if os.path.isdir(location_path):
          list_file_strategies[location] = LocalListFileStrategy(path_pattern=os.path.join(location_path, "*"))
  ```

##### **3. `main`**
- **Purpose**: Execute ingestion strategies for all geographic locations concurrently.
- **Modification**:
  - Processes strategies concurrently using `asyncio.gather`.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  tasks = []
  for location, strategy in strategy_map.items():
      tasks.append(strategy.run())
  await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
  ```

---

#### **3.2 Command-Line Interface Updates**

##### **Argument Changes**
- **Purpose**: Accept a base directory instead of a single file or path.
- **Modification**:
  - Replaced the `files` argument with `base_path`.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  parser.add_argument("base_path", help="Base path containing subdirectories for each geographic location (local files)")
  ```

---

#### **3.3 Workflow Changes**

1. **Dynamic Strategy Creation**:
   - A strategy map was introduced where each location is mapped to its corresponding strategy.
   - **Original Code**:
     ```python
     ingestion_strategy = FileStrategy(...)
     ```
   - **Updated Code**:
     ```python
     strategy_map = {}
     for location, file_strategy in list_file_strategies.items():
         strategy_map[location] = FileStrategy(...)
     ```

2. **Concurrent Execution**:
   - Instead of sequential processing, ingestion strategies are executed concurrently for all locations.
   - **Original Code**:
     ```python
     loop.run_until_complete(strategy.run())
     ```
   - **Updated Code**:
     ```python
     await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
     ```

### **4. Benefits of the Changes**

1. **Scalability**:
   - Supports dynamic addition of geographic locations without modifying core logic.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - Parallel processing of multiple locations reduces overall execution time.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Simplifies file ingestion for multi-location setups.

4. **Maintainability**:
   - Introduced modular functions and mappings to handle geographic locations cleanly.

---

### **5. Conclusion**

The changes made to `prepdocs_updated.py` meet the requirements of multi-indexing for geographic locations, ensuring efficient and scalable processing of data. The updated implementation dynamically detects location folders, appends location identifiers to index names, and processes all locations concurrently while maintaining compatibility with existing functionalities.
