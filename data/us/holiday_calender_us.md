*Note*: When a federal holiday falls on a weekend, the observance date shifts: if on a Saturday, it's observed the preceding Friday; if on a Sunday, the following Monday. 

Additionally, various states and localities may recognize their own holidays or observances, which can vary across regions. Private businesses are not mandated to close on federal holidays; thus, operating hours may differ. It's advisable to check with local institutions for specific holiday schedules.
